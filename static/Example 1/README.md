### Files for the running example from the OptiPass documentation (Box 1).

`Example1.txt` is the barrier file, passed to OP with the `-f` option.

Files named `example_n.txt` are the optimization results for budget levels
from \$0 to \$500K in increments of \$100K.

When the output files are assembled into a single file it should match
the table shown in Box 9 of the OP documentation.
