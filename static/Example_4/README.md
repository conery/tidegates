### Files for the running example from the OptiPass documentation (Box 4).

`Example4.txt` is the barrier file, passed to OP with the `-f` option.  This
file is similar to Example 1, but it has two restoration targets (and the
column names have been changed so they can be parsed by our application but
this will not affect the optimization).

Files named `example_n.txt` are the optimization results for budget levels
from \$0 to \$500K in increments of \$100K.

When the output files are assembled into a single file it should match
the table shown in Box 11 of the OP documentation (except it will have
one column for each budget level).
