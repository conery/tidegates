    The <b>Tide Gate Optimization Tool</b> is a framework for evaluating tide gate replacement opportunities by integrating a variety of input data describing the region, benefit targets, and sea level rise scenarios.
</p>
<p>
    In simple terms, this decision support tool balances the potential gain in benefits against the costs necessary to achieve those benefits. The tool is designed to answer the following question: 
</p>
<blockquote>
    What is the set of tide gates and culverts in the watershed(s) that, if replaced, would maximize net gains for the benefit targets of interest, subject to a limited financial budget?
</blockquote>
 <p>
    In a general sense, the tool involves a flow of data between three actions: (1) preparing input data from field inventories, local knowledge, and a geographic information system (GIS); (2) constructing and executing optimizations; and (3) interpreting and integrating results in decision processes.
