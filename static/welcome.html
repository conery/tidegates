<p>Tide gates on the Oregon coast are reaching maximum life expectancy.  
    Replacing these gates will require a substantial investment in both time and money.
    To help landowners and other stakeholders decide which gates to focus on, The Nature Conservancy developed this <b>Tide Gate Optimization Tool</b>,
    a framework for evaluating tide gate replacement opportunities by integrating a variety of input data describing the region, benefit targets, and sea level rise scenarios.
</p>
    
<p>
    This decision support tool balances the potential gain in benefits against the costs necessary to achieve those benefits. 
    The tool is designed to answer the following question: 
</p>
<blockquote>
    <i>What is the set of tide gates and culverts in the watershed(s) that, if replaced, would maximize net gains for the benefit targets of interest, subject to a limited financial budget?</i>
</blockquote>
 <p>
    In a general sense, the tool involves a flow of data between three actions: (1) preparing input data from field inventories, local knowledge, and a geographic information system (GIS); (2) constructing and executing optimizations; and (3) interpreting and integrating results in decision processes.
