### Files for the running example from the OptiPass documentation (Box 1).

This version has a dummy gate inserted downstream from barrier A.

`Example1.txt` is the barrier file, passed to OP with the `-f` option. The
column names have been changed so they can be parsed by our application but
this will not affect the optimization.

Files named `example_n.txt` are the optimization results for budget levels
from \$0 to \$500K in increments of \$100K.
